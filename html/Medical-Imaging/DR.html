        <h2>Digital Radiography</h2>

        <h3>Limitations of Film Screen System</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Exposure errors are permanent on image</li>
          <li>Faults in the film requires the examination to repeated.</li>
          <li>Delay in viewing the image.</li>
          <li>The dynamic range of the X-ray film is limited.</li>
          <li>Difficult to visualize widely varying tissue denstities</li>
          <li>Storage and retrieval costs</li>
          <li>Copied radiographs are of inferior quality compared to the
            original</li>
          <li>Procedural Issues</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Digital Radiography overcomes limitations of Film Screen
          System</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminate film processing, no dark room or equipment required, no
          film file room.</li>
          <li>Eliminates the necessity for retakes as errors can be fixed using
          software.</li>
          <li>Increased throughput</li>
          <li>Easier image archiving, retrieving and transmission.</li>
          <li>Vastly higher image dynamic ranger- wider exposure and higher
            image SNR (contrast).</li>
          <li>Image is formed almost immediately</li>
          <li>Various image parameters such as contrast, brightness etc can be
          enhanced using software.</li>
          <li>Potentially lower dosage.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> Despite all of these advantages, a major disadvantage of digital
        radiography is that it has lower spatial resolution compared to
        conventional screen film system.</p> 

        <h3>DR: Physical Principles</h3>

        <p> Digital detectors are used to generate a digital radiograph. The
        detector is exposed to x-rays, and the energy absorbed by the detector
        is transformed into electrical signal either directly (direct
        radiography) or indirectly (computed or scanned projection
        radiography).  The electrical signal is recorded, digitized and
        quantified into a gray scale image. Finally, post processing of raw
        data into a clinically meaningful image is performed.</p> 

        <h3>Types of DR</h3>

        <p> DR can be classified into the following categories: </p> 
        <ul>
          <li>Scanned Projection Radiography (SPR)</li>
          <li>Computed Radiography</li>
          <li>Direct Radiography (DR) (This bits confusing)</li>
        </ul>

        <p> SPR was developed as an offshoot of CT. Computed radiography isn't
        exactly a digital radiography. Rather it bridges the gap between
        conventional radiography and digital radiography. The image acquisition
        part of CR is quite similar to conventional screen film system except
        it does not use intensifying screens and employs a PSP image plate as
        detector. The final image is digital nonetheless. DR (Direct
        Radiography) is in its perfect sense a digital radiography. DR system
        uses detectors which convert x-rays into electrical charges by means of
        direct readout process. </p> 

        <p> CR uses PSP plates as the detector, which needs to undergo a
        readout process before an image is formed. Direct radiography uses flat
        panel detectors that do not require to processed for image formation. </p> 

        <h3>Computed Radiography</h3>

        <h3>Direct Radiography</h3>

        <p> Direct radiography is a system in which no cassettes are used,
        instead a large area detector panel is used to capture the x-rays and
        convert them into digital data for subsequent display of image. Now a
        days, a cassette like DR panel without a cable connection is also in
        use. DR is extremely fast in terms of image display and is more
        convenient as the need to carry the cassettes from one place to another
        is eliminated. </p>

        <p> Direct radiography itself is of two types: Indirect DR and Direct
        DR. </p> 

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Indirect (Direct Radiography): Direct in the sense that there is
            no need to undergo an image formation process like in CR or screen
            film system and indirect in the sense that the x-ray photons first
            need to be converted into light photons before they can be
            converted into electrical signals. Indirect DR can be further
            divided into two types based on the detectors used as CCD panel
            based indirect DR and Flat panel based indirect DR.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Direct (Direct Radiography): In direct DR, a photoconductor,
            selenium directly converts the x-ray photons into electrical
            signal. It used flat panel detectors. </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Charged Coupled Devices (CCDs) and CCD based Indirect DR</h4>

        <p>CCDs are photosensitive silicon chips about \( 1/6''\) to \( 1.3''\)
        square size so several may chips may be coupled to cover a required
        FOV. CCDs convert light into electronic signals; when the silicon layer
        in the CCD is illuminated and electric charge is generated. The charge
        accumulate in individual pixels cells. The accumulated charge is read
        out pixel by pixel. Each CCD chip has a discrete pixel electronics
        etched into its surface, for instance a \( 2.5x2.5 cm\) CCD chip may
        have \( 1024x1024\) or \( 2048x2048\) pixels on its surface. </p> 

        <p> In a CCD based indirect DR, the imaging device is a panel
        consisting of a layer of scintillator material such as CsI (not these
        days) or GadOS) above the array of CCDs. CCD based DR panels that has a
        of the dimensions \( 59x48x6 cm^3 \) consists of 240 CCDs and provides
        \( 60.45 \) megapixels image quality.</p> 

        <h4>Flat Panel Detectors and FPD based Indirect DR</h4>

        <p>The technology employed in flat panel detectors is quite analogous
        to that used in laptop computer displays; a series of horizontal and
        vertical electrical lines are used which when combined with appropriate
        readout logic can address each individual display element.</p>
