        <h2>Digital Radiography</h2>

        <h3>Limitations of Film Screen System</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Exposure errors are permanent on image</li>
          <li>Faults in the film requires the examination to repeated.</li>
          <li>Delay in viewing the image.</li>
          <li>The dynamic range of the X-ray film is limited.</li>
          <li>Difficult to visualize widely varying tissue densities</li>
          <li>Storage and retrieval costs</li>
          <li>Copied radiographs are of inferior quality compared to the
            original</li>
          <li>Procedural Issues</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Digital Radiography overcomes limitations of Film Screen
          System</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminate film processing, no dark room or equipment required, no
          film file room.</li>
          <li>Eliminates the necessity for retakes as errors can be fixed using
          software.</li>
          <li>Increased throughput</li>
          <li>Easier image archiving, retrieving and transmission.</li>
          <li>Vastly higher image dynamic ranger- wider exposure and higher
            image SNR (contrast).</li>
          <li>Image is formed almost immediately</li>
          <li>Various image parameters such as contrast, brightness etc can be
          enhanced using software.</li>
          <li>Potentially lower dosage.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> Despite all of these advantages, a major disadvantage of digital
        radiography is that it has lower spatial resolution compared to
        conventional screen film system.</p> 

        <h3>DR: Physical Principles</h3>

        <p> Digital detectors are used to generate a digital radiograph. The
        detector is exposed to x-rays, and the energy absorbed by the detector
        is transformed into electrical signal either directly (direct
        radiography) or indirectly (computed or scanned projection
        radiography).  The electrical signal is recorded, digitized and
        quantified into a gray scale image. Finally, post processing of raw
        data into a clinically meaningful image is performed.</p> 

        <h3>Types of DR</h3>

        <p> DR can be classified into the following categories: </p> 
        <ul>
          <li>Scanned Projection Radiography (SPR)</li>
          <li>Computed Radiography</li>
          <li>Direct Radiography (DR) (This bits confusing)</li>
        </ul>

        <p> SPR was developed as an offshoot of CT. Computed radiography isn't
        exactly a digital radiography. Rather it bridges the gap between
        conventional radiography and digital radiography. The image acquisition
        part of CR is quite similar to conventional screen film system except
        it does not use intensifying screens and employs a PSP image plate as
        detector. The final image is digital nonetheless. DR (Direct
        Radiography) is in its perfect sense a digital radiography. DR system
        uses detectors which convert x-rays into electrical charges by means of
        direct readout process. </p> 

        <p> CR uses PSP plates as the detector, which needs to undergo a
        readout process before an image is formed. Direct radiography uses flat
        panel detectors that do not require to processed for image formation. </p> 

        <h3>Computed Radiography</h3>

        <p>As mentioned earlier, CR is not a pure digital radiographic system.
        It uses photo stimulable phosphor (PSP) plates as the detector. These
        use Eu:BaFX. During exposure, x-ray energy is absorbed temporarily in
        the PSP crystal by exciting electrons to higher energy levels. A
        separate readout process is employed to convert the acquired image
        into a digital image.</p> 

        <h4>PSP Readout</h4>

        <p>The exposed cassette is moved onto a reader unit where the IP is
        mechanically removed from the cassette and scanned pixel by pixel by a
        laser beam. The laser light stimulates emission of trapped energy in
        the imaging plate and a visible light is emitted from the imaging
        plate. The released light is collected by a fiber optics cable that
        guides light to a PMT (Photomultiplier tube) where it is converted into
        an electronic signal.</p> 

        <h3>Direct Radiography</h3>

        <p> Direct radiography is a system in which no cassettes are used,
        instead a large area detector panel is used to capture the x-rays and
        convert them into digital data for subsequent display of image. Now a
        days, a cassette like DR panel without a cable connection is also in
        use. DR is extremely fast in terms of image display and is more
        convenient as the need to carry the cassettes from one place to another
        is eliminated. </p>

        <p> Direct radiography itself is of two types: Indirect DR and Direct
        DR. </p> 

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Indirect (Direct Radiography): Direct in the sense that there is
            no need to undergo an image formation process like in CR or screen
            film system and indirect in the sense that the x-ray photons first
            need to be converted into light photons before they can be
            converted into electrical signals. Indirect DR can be further
            divided into two types based on the detectors used as CCD panel
            based indirect DR and Flat panel based indirect DR.</p>

            <p>Both types of indirect DRs use CsI of GdOS scintillator
            detectors, although nowadays GdOS are used extensively. CsI
            phosphors used in indirect DRs have high detector quantum
            efficiency (DQE) which opts for lower patient dosage.  <span
              class="equation"> \[ DQE = \% \text{of X-ray absorbed by the
              phosphors}\] </span> </p> </li>
          <li>

            <p>Direct (Direct Radiography): In direct DR, a photoconductor,
            selenium directly converts the x-ray photons into electrical
            signal. It used flat panel detectors. </p>

            <p>DDR uses a-Se only which eliminates spreading of light in the
            phosphor which opts for better spatial resolution.</p> 

          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Charged Coupled Devices (CCDs) and CCD based Indirect DR</h4>

        <p>CCDs are photosensitive silicon chips about \( 1/6''\) to \( 1.3''\)
        square size so several may chips may be coupled to cover a required
        FOV. CCDs convert light into electronic signals; when the silicon layer
        in the CCD is illuminated and electric charge is generated. The charge
        accumulate in individual pixels cells. The accumulated charge is read
        out pixel by pixel. Each CCD chip has a discrete pixel electronics
        etched into its surface, for instance a \( 2.5x2.5 cm\) CCD chip may
        have \( 1024x1024\) or \( 2048x2048\) pixels on its surface. </p> 

        <p> In a CCD based indirect DR, the imaging device is a panel
        consisting of a layer of scintillator material such as CsI (not these
        days) or GadOS) above the array of CCDs. CCD based DR panels that has a
        of the dimensions \( 59x48x6 cm^3 \) consists of 240 CCDs and provides
        \( 60.45 \) megapixels image quality.</p> 

        <h4>Flat Panel Detectors and FPD based Indirect DR</h4>

        <p>The technology employed in flat panel detectors is quite analogous
        to that used in laptop computer displays; a series of horizontal and
        vertical electrical lines are used which when combined with appropriate
        readout logic can address each individual display element. With this
        approach only 2,000 connections between the detector panel and the
        readout electronics are required for a \( 1000x1000\) display instead
        of 1,000,000 individual connections. </p> 

        <p>In FPD based indirect DR, a CsI or \( Gd_2O_2S\) scintillation
        phosphor is coated over an active matrix array (AMA) of a-Si TFTs. The
        DR image receptor is fabricated into individual pixels and each pixel
        has a light sensitive face of a-Si, a capacitor and a TFT embedded into
        it.</p> 

        <h4>Thin Film Transistors (TFTs)</h4>

        <p>TFT arrays are used as the active electronic element in both direct
        and indirect DRs based of FPDs. TFT arrays are typically deposited onto
        a glass substrate in multiple layers, beginning with readout
        electronics at the lower levels and followed by charge collector arrays
        at higher levels. X-ray elements, light sensitive elements or both are
        deposited to form the topmost layer of this electronic sandwich. The
        entire assembly is encased in a protective enclosure with the external
        cabling for computer connection.</p> 

        <h4>Readout Process of TFTs</h4>

        TFTs can be read either directly or indirectly. In FPD based DDR, the
        image forming x-rays directly interacts with a thing layer of a-Se
        creating an electron-hole pair. a-Se of about \( 200 \mu m\) is
        sandwiched between charged electrodes. The electron hole-pair is the
        signal that charges the AMA of TFTs.
