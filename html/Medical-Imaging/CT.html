        <h2>Computed Tomography CT</h2>

        <p> A computed tomography is an imaging technique that involves
        capturing multiple projections of a 3D object and reconstucting the
        image of that object from those projections using complex mathematical
        algorithms. </p>

        <p> The basic principle of CT is that the internal structure of an
        object can be reconstructed form multiple projections of that
        object</p>

        <h3>CT Generations</h3>
        
        <h4>First Gen CT</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>X-ray beam was collimated to a (pencil width) narrow beam and
            was detected by a single detector.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The xray tube and the scintillation detectors were rigidly
            linked (fixed).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Starting at a particular angle, the x-ray tube and the detector
            system translated linealy across the FOV acquiring 160 parallel
            rays per view. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>After each translation cycle, x-ray tube and the
            detectors rotated by 1<sup>o</sup> until path length of
            180<sup>o<\sup> was covered. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In this tranlate-rotate motion, a total of 180 x 160 = 28,800
            projections were made.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>These were specifically designed for imaging the internal
            strucutures of the skull.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The advantage of this system was there was minimum scatter
            raditation. But the major drawback was the duration (around 5 mins)
            that it took to scan a single image. Furthemore, the contrast
            resolution of internal structures was unprecedented and images had
            poor spatial resoultion.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>


        <h4>Second Gen CT</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p> Instead of a pencil beam, like in the first gen ct, a fan beam
            of around 3 to 10 degress were used. And the rotation angle was
            also increased by ten folds to the first gen ct.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The number of detectors were also increased up to 30 detectors.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>With 10 degree rotation increment, only 18 translations were
            required for a 180<sup>o</sup> image acquisition. This change only
            made second gen cts x15 faster compared to the fitst gen.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The disadvantage of the second gen ct was that the complexity of
            the (translate-rotate) system prevented it from being further
            improved.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Even a small deviations in milimeters of the scanner hardware
            position, relateive to the reconstruction voxels would cause data
            to be back projected through wrong voxels, creating several
            artefacts.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The fan beam used in the second gen ct, although it covered bore
            area, had the disadvantage that the radiation intensity would
            increase toward the edge. A bow-tie filter could be used to
            minimize this but it would also limi the range of intensity
            reaching detector and hardens the beam.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Third Gen Ct</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The third gen ct completely discarded the translate-rotate
            tube-detector system of the first and the second gen ct and opted
            for a full rotational mechanism.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It used wide angle fan beams of around 50 to 55 degress and the
            number of detectors was increased to more thean 800 detectors. The
            x-ray tube was the apex of the fan beam.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>This sort of arrangement allowed third generation ct scanners to
            make a scan in a matter of a few seconds.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The primary disadvantage of this system was that the use of
            larger number of detectors affected the spatial resoultion up to a
            certain degree. Furthermore, the detector array required high
            stablility. Any error or drift in the calibration of the detectors
            relative to other detectors would lead to back projectoins along
            the ray and path and reinforcement along a ring where they cross.
            This would result in an artefact known as the ring artefact.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Ring artefacts are never completely eliminated, rahter minimized
            by high quality detectors design and frequent calibration. Residual
            righ artifacts are removed by image processing algorithms.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Another disadvantage arised in sampling. The sample size and
            spacing were fixed by the detector desing. Samples cannot be closer
            than the distance between rays associated with the detector at the
            lever of center of rotation. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Fourth Gen CT</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Fourth generation ct scanner employed a large number of
            stationary <bold>ring</bold> of detectors and a rotating xray tube.
            Meaning only, the x-ray tube would rotate around the patient. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It employed round 4800 individual detector and spatial
            resolution of moer than 20 lp/cm. Each individual detector was the
            apex of the fan beam used in 4 <sup>th</sup> gen ct which is in
            contrast with the 3 <sup>rd</sup> gen.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The scan time in fourth generation ct was a fraction of a
            second. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The disadvantage of fourth gen ct was that becuase the tube
            rotated inside the detectory ring, large ring diameter was needed.
            On the other hand, acceptable spatial resolution limited the
            detector aperture to approximately 4mm.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Scatter radiation was more because the septa used in the
            3 <sup>rd</sup> generation of ct could not be used as the septa
            needed to be aimed at the center of the ring. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Fifth Gen CT</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Used for cardiac imaging. Previous generations of CT could not
            be used for cardiac imaging because it required ultra fast scanning
            times \(<50ms\) which was difficult to attain. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Scan time in 5\(^{th}\) gen ct was as little as 10 to 20 ms.
            Such little scan time was possible through use of a large bell
            shaped x-ray tube rather than conventional X-ray tube. A large arc
            of tungsten encircles the patient ad lies directly opposite to the
            detector ring.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>An electron beams produced from an electron gun placed behind
            the gantry strikes tungsten arc. The electron beam is produced in
            cone like structures and are electronically steered around the
            patient so that it strikes the target. X-ray are produced when the
            electrons strike the tungsten target. This concept is knows as the
            Electron beam CT.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>EBCT is limited only to cardiac imaging due to the image quality
            for general screening is lower than of conventional CT and also due
            to high equipment costs.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Cardiac scanning mostly is done by multislice CT, so the future
            of EBCT is rather uncertain.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
