        <h3>Introduction to MRI</h3>

        <p> MRI is an imaging modality that produces tomographic images by means
        of strong magnetic fields and radio frequency (RF) pulses. Tomography is
        a method of producing a three-dimensional image of internal structures
        of a solid object (such as the human body) by the observation and
        recording of the differences in the effects on the passage of waves of
        energy impinging on those structures. </p>

        The basic procedure to produce an MRI image is:

        <ol> <li>Put the patient inside a strong magnetic field. The patient is
            placed inside a large hollow magnet.</li> <li>Once the patient is
            placed inside the magnet, an RF pulse is sent for a certain amount
            of time.</li> <li>Another RF signal is received which is used to
            construct the MR image.</li> </ol>

        <h3>Nuclear Magnetism: Production of Net Magnetization</h3>

        <p>MR Imaging is based upon the interaction between an applied magnetic
        field and a nucleus that possesses a spin. Every element in the periodic
        table except Ag and Ce has at least one naturally occurring isotope that
        posses spin. Thus, in theory, nearly every element can be examined using
        MR. </p>

        <p> Atoms consist of three fundamental particles: protons, neutrons and
        electrons. The protons and neutrons are located in the nucleus of the
        atom, where as electrons remain in the orbits. The atomic number is the
        number of protons in the nucleus and the atomic number for a given atom
        never changes.  The atomic weight is the sum of the number of protons
        and neutrons. Atoms with the same atomic number but different atomic
        weights are called isotopes. The atomic number and the atomic weight are
        the properties of nucleus. Nuclear spin is a third intrinsic property of
        the nucleus.  A rotating nucleus produces a magnetic moment (which
        essentially is a magnetic field), oriented parallel to the axis of
        rotation. This is analogous to a bar magnet in which the magnetic field
        is considered to be oriented from the south to the north pole. Since
        a nucleus is charged (positively), with rotating nucleus, its charges
        i.e. protons also rotate. A rotating proton acts like a current loop
        that produces a magnetic moment. This associated magnetic moment is
        fundamental to MR. </p>

        <img class="center" src="../../images/med-imaging/Nuclear-spin.png"
        alt=""/>

        <p>A rigorous mathematical description of a nucleus with spin and its
        interactions requires us to dive deep into the realms of quantum
        mechanics, however most of MR can be described using concepts of
        classical mechanics.</p>

        <p> Since a <sup>1</sup>H, protium is the most prevalent isotope of the
        Hydrogen atom and since hydrogen consists of only one proton, MR
        concepts are usually described using the <sup>1</sup>H atom. In the
        human body, there are millions of protons that produce a magnetic field
        of certain magnitude. However, the protons in our body are randomly
        oriented which causes the net magnetic moment of the human body to be
        zero. </p>

        <img class="center"
        src="../../images/med-imaging/Randomly-oriented-protiums.png"
        alt="Orientation of protons in the absence of an external magnetic
        field."/>

        <p> When these protons are placed inside an external magnetic field,
        they begin to precess about the magnetic field. The protons are tilted
        slightly away from the axis of the magnetic field, yet the axis of
        rotation is parallel to \(B_o\). The movement of the proton is same as
        the toy named latoo. </p>

        <img class="center"
        src="../../images/med-imaging/Precession-of-a-Proton-in-a-Superimposed-DC-Magnetic-Field.png"
        alt="Precession Illustration"/>

        <p> By convention, the axis of the magnetic field and the axis of
        rotation are defined to be oriented in the \(z\) direction of
        a cartesian coordinate system. The motion of the proton can be described
        by a unique set of coordinates. The above figure represents the
        precession of a proton inside a magnetic field where the precessional
        axis is parallel to the magnetic field \(B_o\). The z-component of the
        spin vector does not change in magnitude or direction as the proton
        precesses, only the x and the y components vary with respect to
        time.</p>

        <p> The <u>frequency of precession</u> is extremely important in MRI and
        is highly influenced by the strength \((B_o)\) of the external magnetic
        field. It is possible and necessary to precisely calculate the frequency
        of precession using the Larmour Equation. </p>

        <span class="equation"> \[ \omega_o = \gamma B_o \] where, </span>


        <div class="equationDetails">

          \( \omega_o \) is the frequency of precession (referred to as Larmour
          frequency)<br/>

          \(\gamma\) is the Gyromagnetic ratio; \(42.5 MHz/T\) for proton <br/>

          \(B_o\) is the magnitude of the external magnetic field in Tesla (T)
          <br/>

        </div>

        <p> The spinning protons have charge as well as mass. The fact that the
        proton has mass means a spinning proton will posses a certain moment of
        inertia \((I)\), which resists the changes to its angular momentum
        \((\alpha)\). This inhibits the nucleus from aligning in the magnetic
        field. The inhibiting factor is referred to as the gyromagnetic ratio
        and is measured as the ratio of the magnetic moment to the moment of
        inertia. Its unit is \(MHz/T\). The gyromagnetic ratio is different for
        different materials; its value for proton is \(42.5MHz/T\). </p>

        <p> The gyromagnetic ratio is fixed for each element which means the
        frequency of precession is also fixed for a given magnetic field
        strength.  So in a uniform magnetic field, a nucleus of a given atom
        will rotate with exactly the same frequency and this frequency is known
        as the Larmour frequency.  </p>

        <p> The spin orientations are still randomly distributed in the
        direction perpendicular to the \(B_o\) as they were outside the magnetic
        field, in spite of the time varying nature of each transverse
        component. This means there is no net magnetization perpendicular to
        \(B_o\). However, in the direction parallel to the magnetic field, there
        is a constant and nonzero interaction (or coupling) between the proton
        and \(B_o\) which causes the protons to align either parallel or
        antiparallel with the external magnetic field. This is known as Zeeman
        interaction. This coupling causes a difference in energy between protons
        aligned parallel (along \(B_o\) and protons aligned antiparallel
        (against \(B_o\)). The protons oriented parallel to \(B_o\) is of lower
        energy than the protons aligned in antiparallel. </p>

        <img class="center"
             src="../../images/med-imaging/Atoms-aligned-parallel-or-antiparallel-to-B-0.png"
             alt="Orientation of protons in presence of an external mangetic
                  field."/>

        <p> For a collection of protons, more will be oriented parallel to
        \(B_o\) than antiparallel. In the absence of \(B_o\), there is no
        preferential alignment between orientations (left). In the presence of
        magnetic field (right), the spin up orientation is of lower energy and
        its configuration contains more protons than the higher energy spin down
        configuration. The difference in the energy \(\Delta E\) between the two
        levels is proportional to \(B_o\). </p>

        <img class="center" src="../../images/med-imaging/Zeeman-Diagram.png"
                            alt=""/>

        <p> So, for a set of protons, in the presence of external magnetic
        field, the precession would look something as follows: </p>

        <img class="center"
             src="../../images/med-imaging/Pression-of-multiple-Protons-inside-a-magentic-field.png"
             alt=""/>

        <p> Clearly, the precession vectors form two cones, one with a positive
        \(z\)-component and one with a negative \(z\)-component. Now, since
         there are more protons in the upper cone, there will be a non-zero
         vector sum which means a net magnetization of <span class="highlight">
         constant magnitude,</span> \(M_o\) is produced. The orientation of
         this net magnetization is in the same direction as \(B_o\). </p>

        <h3>Concepts of Magnetic Resonance</h3>

        <h4>Magnetic Resonance</h4>

        <p> Nuclear MR or simply MR, in its most basic form is the transfer of
        energy between the precessing protons in the external magnetic field and
        an applied radio frequency pulse. For NMR to occur, the applied RF pulse
        must have exactly the same frequency as that of the precessing
        protons. When the frequencies are equal, the oscillation of particles
        hits peak and resonance occurs. The MR image is simply a frequency and
        phase map of the resonating protons at different points inside a strong,
        non-homogeneous magnetic fields. </p>

        <h4>Magnetic Field Inhomogeneity</h4>

        <p> There are three main causes for magnetic fields inhomogeneity:</p>

        <ol>

          <li><b>Main fields inhomogeneity:</b> There is always some degree of
            non-uniformity to \(B_o\) due to imperfections in magnet
            manufacturing, composition of nearby building walls, or other
            sources of metal. This main field inhomogeneity is constant. </li>
          <br/>

          <li><b>Sample-induced inhomogeneity:</b> The degree of magnetic
            polarization of adjacent tissues due to the differences in their
            magnetic susceptibility (e.g. bone, air) will distort the local
            magnetic field near the interface between different tissues. This
            inhomogeneity is constant and  present as long as the sample/patient
            is inside the magnet. </li> <br/>

          <li><b>Imaging Gradients:</b> In MRI, imaging gradients, which are
            essentially magnetic field gradients are used to obtain
            inhomogeneity. This inhomogeneity produced due to gradients is
        transient. </li> </ol>

        <h4>Magnetic Field Gradient</h4>

        <p> In MRI, the strength of the magnetic field is different at different
        points of the magnet. This is achieved through the application of
        magnetic field gradients. A magnetic field gradient is a small
        disturbance in the magnetic field strength with respect to
        position. This means that the exact magnetic field is linearly dependent
        on the location inside the magnet as related by the equation below:</p>

        <span class="equation">\[B_i = B_o + G_T \otimes r_i\] where, \(B_i\) is
          the magnetic field at location \(r_i\) and \(G_T\) is a tensor that
          represents the total gradient amplitude. Note: if A is an \(m \times
          n\) matrix and B is a \(p \times q\) matrix, then the Kronecker
          product \(A \otimes B\) is a \(pm \times qn\) matrix. </span>

        <p> The gradients used in MRI produce linear variations primarily in one
        direction only, so the tensor product in the above equation can be
        reduced to a vector. The symbols for a magnetic field gradient in the x,
        y, and z directions are \(G_x, G_y,\) and \(G_z\). Now, if each of the
        regions of spin experiences a unique magnetic field, the Larmour
        equation needs to be modified as follows: </p>

        <span class="equation">\[\omega_i = \gamma\,(B_o + G \cdot r_i) \]</span>

        <p> This equation tells us that each proton will resonate at a unique
        frequency that is relative to its position within the gradient
        field. The fact that each proton resonates at a different frequency
        makes it easier to image their positions. Furthermore, although each of
        these \(G_x, G_y\) and \(G_z\) are quintessential to obtain an image,
        they need to be eliminated as a source of proton dephasing during the
        \(T2\) relaxation. Proper design of the pulse sequence prevents these
        gradients from contributing in proton dephasing. A pulse sequence is the
        combination of excitation pulses (rf pulses), gradient pulses, data
        sampling periods and the timing between each of them. </p>


        <h4>Excitation Pulse</h4>

        <p> During MR process, the patient or sample is exposed to energy that
        will be absorbed. A short time later, this energy is re-emitted which
        can be then detected and processed. The entire field of MR is based on
        the manipulation of the net magnetization formed by the protons within
        a sample when placed inside an strong magnetic field. The simples
        manipulation involves the application of a short radio-frequency (rf)
        pulse. This pulse is also known as the excitation pulse, and contains
        many frequencies spread over a narrow bandwidth. As the excitation pulse
        is applied, the protons absorb a certain portion of this energy at
        a particular frequency. The frequency absorbed is proportional to the
        strength of the magnetic field \(B_o\) as related by the Larmour
        equation. </p>

        <p>The rf pulse is applied with a central frequency \(\omega_o\) and an
        orientation perpendicular to the external magnetic field \(B_o\)&nbsp;,
        indicated by \(B_1\) in the figure down below. </p>

        <img class="center" src="../../images/med-imaging/RF-pulse-orientation.png"
              alt=""/>

        <p> This orientation difference allows a coupling between the rf pulse
        and \(M_o\) so that energy can be transferred to protons (In physics,
        two objects are said to be coupled when they are interacting with each
        other).  Absorption of rf energy of frequency \(\omega_o\) causes
        \(M_o\) to rotate away from its equilibrium orientation. The direction
        of rotation of \(M_o\) is perpendicular to both \(B_o\) and
        \(B_1\). Now, if the rf pulse is applied for long enough at a high
        enough amplitude, the energy absorbed by the protons causes \(M_o\) to
        rotate entirely into the transverse plane by 90<sup>o</sup>. This pulse
        that rotates the net magnetization \(M_o\) by 90<sup>o</sup> is referred
        to as a 90<sup>o</sup> pulse. </p>

        <img class="center"
             src="../../images/med-imaging/Net-magnetization-rotating.png" alt=""/>

        <p> As seen in the above figure, the net magnetization decreases in the
        longitudinal direction and increases in the transverse direction. The
        pulse amplitude or, more precisely, the pulse amplitude integral,
        determines the amount of rotation that the protons undergo (flip
        angle). In addition, the pulse amplitude is related to the amount of
        energy that the protons absorb and therefore must dissipate through (T1)
        relaxation. </p>

        <p>Each rf pulse will have the following things defined:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Amplitude</li>
          <li>Central frequency (resonant frequency of protons)</li>
          <li>Duration</li>
          <li>Shape/Envelope</li>
          <li>Phase</li>
        </ul>

        <p> For a pulse to excite a particular frequency, that frequency must be
        included within its bandwidth. The duration and the shape of the pulse
        determine the bandwidth or range of frequencies on either side of the
        central frequency that are excited by the pulse. The phase of the pulse
        determines the axis of rotation for the net magnetization under the
        influence of the pulse. </p>

        <h4>Free Induction Decay</h4>

        <p> When the rf pulse is stopped, the protons immediately begin to
        realign themselves and return to their original orientation by emitting
        energy at frequency \(\omega_o\). As a result, the net magnetization
        will begin to precess about \(B_o\). If a loop of wire (a receiver coil)
        is placed perpendicular to the transverse plane, the protons induce
        a voltage in the wire during their precession. This induced voltage is
        the MR signal and is known as the <abbr title="Free Induction
          Decay">FID</abbr>. The magnitude of the FID signal depends on the
        value of \(M_o\) immediately prior to the \(90^o\) pulse. The FID signal
        decays with time as more of the protons give up their absorbed rf energy
        through a process known as relaxation. </p>

        <img class="center" src="../../images/med-imaging/FID.png" alt=""/>

        <p> The <abbr title="Free Induction Decay">FID</abbr> is maximum when
        a \(90^o\) pulse is used. If all the protons experience the same
        magnetic field \(B_o\), then only one frequency would be present in the
        FID. However, in reality, there are many magnetic fields through out the
        magnet, which is referred to as inherent magnetic field inhomogeneity.
        Due to this inherent magnetic inhomogeneity, many MR signals at many
        frequencies are produced. These signals are superimposed so that the FID
        contains many frequencies varying as a function of time. (It is easier
        to examine such a multi-component signal in terms of frequencies rather
        than of time so the signal amplitudes are converted from a function of
        time to a function of frequency using Fourier transformation.) </p>

        <h3>Relaxation</h3>

        <p> Relaxation is the process by which protons release the energy that
        they absorbed from the rf pulse. Relaxation is a fundamental process in
        MR, and is just as essential as the energy absorption. Relaxation
        provides the primary mechanism for image contrast. </p>

        <p> In resonance absorption, rf energy is absorbed by protons only when
        their frequencies match. The absorbed energy disturbs the equilibrium
        parallel and anti-parallel orientation of protons to the external
        magnetic field. Shortly after excitation, relaxation occurs in which the
        protons release the additional energy that they absorbed and return to
        their equilibrium configuration. Although individual protons absorb
        energy, relaxation times are measured for an entire sample and are
        statistical measurements. Two distinct relaxation times can be measured,
        known as \(T1\) and \(T2\) relaxation times. </p>

        <h4>T1 Relaxation</h4>

        <p> T1 relaxation time is time required for the \(z\)-component of the
        net magnetization \(M_o\) to return to \(63\%\) of its original value
        following an excitation pulse. It is also known as spin-lattice
        relaxation time or longitudinal relaxation time. </p>

        <p> We know that the net-magnetization \(M_o\) is parallel to \(B_o\) at
        equilibrium. When rf-pulse is broadcast, the protons will absorb energy
        which inturn will rotate \(M_o\) into the transverse plane. \(T1\)
        relaxation provides the mechanism by which the protons give up their
        energy to return to their original orientation. If a \(90^o\) pulse is
        broadcast to the sample, \(M_o\) will rotate full \(90^o\) such that
        there will be no longitudinal magnetization present following the
        pulse. As time goes on, the longitudinal magnetization will return as
        the protons release their energy through \(T_1\) relaxation. Gradually,
        as more protons release their energy, a ranger fraction of \(M_z\) is
        re-established. The change of \(M_z/M_o\) with time \(\tau\) follows an
        exponential growth process as shown in the figure down below: </p>

        <img class="center" src="../../images/med-imaging/T1-relaxation.png"
             alt="T1 relaxation curve"/>
        <figure>
          <figcaption>T1 Relaxation Curve</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> As seen in the figure above, the return of longitudinal
        magnetization follows an exponential growth process, with \(T1\) being
        the time constant describing the rate of growth as illustrated by the
        equation down below:</p>

        <span class="equation">\[ M(\tau) = M_o (1 - e^{-\tau/T1}) \] where,
        </span>

        <div class="equationDetails">

          \(\tau\) is the time following the excitation pulse <br/>

          \(T1\) is the time constant, and is the time when \(M_z\) has returned
          to \(63\%\) of its original value. <br/>

        </div>

        <p> After three \(T1\) time periods, \(M_z\) will have returned to
        \(95\%\) of its value prior to excitation pulse i.e. \(M_o\). The excited
        proton (spin) transfers its energy to its surroundings (lattice) rather
        than to another spin and for this reason this \(T1\) relaxation is also
        called spin lattice relaxation. </p>

        <p> Now, suppose the rf energy is continuously applied at the resonant
        frequency so that no relaxation occurs. The protons in the lower energy
        level absorb the rf energy, and the protons in the upper energy level
        are stimulated to emit their energy. Since energy is continuously
        transmitted, the proton populations of the two levels will gradually
        equalize. When this equalization occurs, no further net absorption of
        energy is possible, a condition known as saturation. The \(M\) will
        rotate continuously but gradually get smaller in magnitude until it
        disappears as the net population difference approaches zero. Since there
        is no net magnetization, there will be no coherence of proton motion in
        the transverse plane and thus no signal will be produced. Therefore,
        there is only a limited amount of energy that a collection of protons
        can absorb before they become saturated. </p>

        <p> In a modern MR, pulsed rf energy is applied to the protons
        repeatedly with a delay time between the pulses. This time between
        pulses allows the excited protons to relax (give up the absorbed
        energy). As the protons give up the energy to their surrounding, the
        population difference (spin up vs spin down) is re-established. As \(M\)
        is the ultimate source of the MR signal, the more that is dissipated,
        the more signal that will be generated following the next rf pulse. The
        time between successive rf pulses is usually insufficient for complete
        \(T1\) relaxation due to which \(M\) will not be completely restored to
        \(M_o\). However, the application of the second rf pulse prior to the
        complete relaxation will rotate \(M\) into the transverse plane with
        a smaller magnitude than the previous rf pulse. The following describes
        this situation. </p>

        <img class="center" src="../../images/med-imaging/T1-relaxtion-steps.png"
             alt="">

        <ul>

          <li>Application of a \(90^o\) pulse rotates M into the transverse
            plane. </li>

          <li>Elapsed time \(\tau\) is insufficient for complete \(T1\)
            relaxation due to which the longitudinal magnetization, \(M^{'}\) at
            the end of \(\tau\) is less than \(M\). The difference between \(M\)
          and \(M^{'}\) is \(a\). </li>

          <li>A second \(90^o\) rf pulse rotates \(M^{'}\) into the transverse
            plane. </li>

          <li> As \(\tau\) time elapses, a longitudinal magnetization \(M^{''}\)
            is produced. The difference between \(M^{'}\) and \(M^{''}\) is
            \(b\) and is smaller than \(a\).</li>

        </ul>

        After a few repetitions, \(M\) returns to the original magnitude prior
        to the application of the very first rf pulse i.e. \(M\) achieves
        a steady value. There are five factors the affect the steady-state
        value:

        <ol>

          <li>Strength of the external magnetic field \(B_o\). Larger the value
            of \(B_o\), larger the value of \(M\). </li>

          <li>Proton density i.e. the number of protons producing the
            \(M\).</li>

          <li>The amount of energy absorbed by protons.</li>

          <li>The duration between two successive rf pulses i.e. \(\tau\). </li>

          <li>The efficiency of protons in giving up their energy
            i.e. \(T1\).</li>

        </ol>

        <p>This steady state of \(M\) must be achieved prior to data collection,
        therefore additional rf pulses known as dummy pulses must be applied
        immediately prior to the main imaging pulses. </p>

        <p>T1 is different for different tissues this is because H atom is
        tighter in H than in Water. </p>

        <h4>T2 Relaxation</h4>

        <p> The \(T2\) relaxation time is the time required for the transverse
        component of \(M\) to decay to \(37\%\) of its initial value. The \(T2\)
        relaxation is also known as the spin-spin relaxation or transverse
        relaxation time. </p>

        <img class="center"
             src="../../images/med-imaging/T2-relaxation-curve.png"

        <figure>
          <figcaption>T2 relaxation curve</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> The plot above shows the \(M_{xy}\) component as a function of
        time. The change in \(M_{xy}/M_{xy_{max}}\) with time follows an
        exponential decay process. The time constant for this process is the
        spin-spin relaxation time \(T2\) and is the time when \(M_{xy}\) has
        decayed to \(37\%\) of its original value. The \(T2\) relaxation rate is
        also different for different tissues. </p>

        <img class="center"
             src="../../images/med-imaging/T2-relaxation-steps.png"
             alt="T2 Relaxation Steps"/>
        <figure>
          <figcaption>T2 relaxation</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> At equilibrium, \(M_o\) is parallel to \(B_o\) and no portion of
        \(M_o\) is the \(xy\)-plane and the coherence is entirely longitudinal
        (1). Absorption of energy from a \(90^o\) rf pulse causes \(M_o\) to
        rotate entirely into the \(xy\)-plane, so that the coherence is in the
        transverse plane&nbsp;(2). Following the \(90^o\) rf pulse, when the
        protons have absorbed energy and are oriented in the transverse plane,
        each proton precesses in phase at the same frequency (3). However, due
        to the spin-spin relaxation and inherent magnetic inhomogeneity, the
        protons begin to precess at different frequencies and get out of phase
        (4,5). As more time elapses, the transverse coherence becomes smaller
        (as protons release their energy and reoreint themselves parallel to
        \(B_0\)) until there is complete randomness of the transverse components
        and no coherence (6). This process of getting from total in-phase
        situation to total out-of-phase situation is called \(T2\)
        relaxation. This dephasing time \(T2\) is always less than or equal to
        \(T1\) relaxation time. </p>

        <p> Since a nearby proton of the same type will have the same molecular
        environment and the same \(\omega_o\) , it can readily absorb the energy
        that is being transferred from an excited proton. As a result, the
        absorbed energy remains as spin excitation rather than being transferred
        to the lattice as in \(T1\) relaxation. </p>

        <figure>
        <img class="center" src="../../images/med-imaging/Spin-Spin.png" alt="Spin-Spin relaxation"/>
        <figcaption class="center">Spin-Spin relaxation</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>As seen in figure (a), two mater molecules are in close proximity;
        one spin on one molecule has absorbed rf energy and is excited (spin
        down). Since two water molecules are in close proximity, the energy from
        one molecule can be transferred to a spin on the second molecule as seen
        in figure (b). </p>

        <h4>T2<sup>*</sup> Relaxation</h4>

        <p> Along with the spin-spin relaxation, the inherent magnetic
        inhomogeneity also contributes to the protons getting out-of-phase.
        Main-field inhomogeneity and the sample-induced inhomogeneity are two
        factors that contribute to the total transverse relaxation time \(T2^*\)
        as related by the following equation: </p>

        <span class="equation">\[ 1/T2^* = 1/T2 + 1/T2_M + 1/T2_{SD} \]
        where,</span>

        <div class="equationDetails">
          \(T2\) is the dephasing time due to the spin-spin relaxation <br/>
          \(T2_M\) is the dephasing time due to the main field inhomogeneity
          <br/>
          \(T2_{SD}\) is the dephasing time due to magnetic susceptibility
          differences.
        </div>

        <p> For most tissues \(T2_M\) is the major factor in determining
        \(T2^*\), whereas for tissues with air filled cavities, \(T2_{SD}\)
        predominates \(T2^*\). So, the decay of the transverse magnetization
        following a 90° rf pulse, follows an exponential process with the time
        constant of T2* rather than just T2: </p>

        <span class="equation">\[ M_{xy}(\tau) = M_{xy_{max}} e^{(-\tau/T2^*)} \]</span>

        <p> The main field inhomogeneity and magnetic susceptibility differences
        which contribute to the dephasing of protons can be reversed by applying
        a \(180^o\) rf pulse after a short delay of time \(\tau\) following the
        \(90^o\) pulse. The initial \(90^o\) pulse rotates \(M_o\) into the
        transverse plane. During time \(\tau\), proton dephasing occurs through
        \(T2^*\) relaxation process and the transverse coherence will diminish
        as explained above. Application of a \(180^o\) pulse causes the protons
        to reverse their phases relative to their resonant frequency. The rate
        of precession does not change, only the relative phase changes. As time
        \(\tau\) elapses following the \(180^0\) pulse, the protons will regain
        their transverse coherence. This reformation of phase coherence induces
        another signal known as the spin echo. Moreover, the contributions to
        \(T2^*\) relaxation from the static main field inhomogeneity and
        susceptibility differences will disappear but the spin-spin relaxation
        remains unaffected by the \(180^o\) pulse. This means that the loss of
        transverse coherence and signal amplitude for a spin echo is due to true
        \(T2\) relaxation. </p>

        <h4>Difference between T2 and T2<sup>*</sup> Relaxation</h4>

        <p> One important difference between \(T2\) and \(T2^*\) relaxation is
        the influence of \(B_o\). \(T2\) is insensitive to very high values of
        \(B_o\); only at very low values of \(B_o\), less than \(0.5T\) will
        there be significant changes in \(T2\). But other components of \(T2^*\)
        i.e. \(T2_M\) and \(T2_{SD}\) become more prominent at higher
        \(B_o\). Uniformity is more difficult to achieve in high magnetic fields
        due to which \(T2_M\) is shorter. In addition, greater \(B_o\) will also
        cause greater difference in the \(M_o\) between two tissues with
        different magnetic susceptibilities, producing shorter \(T2_{SD}\). As
        a result \(T2\)-weighted techniques are insensitive to \(B_o\) whereas
        the <br> \(T2^*\)-weighted techniques will show greater signal
        differences at higher \(B_o\). </p>

        <h3>Imaging Cycle</h3>

        <p> The image acquisition process consists of an imaging cycle which
        inturn is comprised of two distinct phases. One phase is associated with
        the longitudinal magnetization and the other phase is associated with
        the transverse magnetization. The duration of these two phases are
        determined by two factors: repetition time TR and echo time TE. Along
        with TR and TE some additional concepts needed to understand the image
        cycle are described below: </p>

        <img class="center" src="../../images/med-imaging/One-MR-imaging-cycle.png"
           alt="One imaging cycle">
        <figure>
          <figcaption>Imaging Cycle</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <dl>
          <dt>Saturation</dt>

          <dd> In the beginning of each imaging cycle, the longitudinal
            magnetization is reduced to zero (saturation) by an RF pulse, and
            then allowed to regrow, or relax. This is what happens in the spin
            echo method. In some other imaging methods, the cycle might begin
            with either partially saturated or inverted longitudinal
            magnetization. </dd> <br/>

          <dt>Excitation </dt>

          <dd> Excitation is the transition from the longitudinal magnetization
            phase to the transverse magnetization phase; it is called excitation
            because transverse magnetization is a lot more unstable or excited
            than longitudinal magnetization. An excitation process is
            characterized by a flip angle. A \(90^o\) rf pulse converts all of the
            existing longitudinal magnetization into transverse
            magnetization. Flip angles less than \(90^o\) converts only
            a proportion of the longitudinal magnetization into transverse
            magnetization. </dd> <br/>

          <dt>Echo Event</dt>

          <dd> The transverse magnetization phase terminates with the echo event,
            which involves echoing an RF signal. This signal is emitted by tissues
            and used to form the image. </dd> <br/>

          <dt> Repetition Time (TR) </dt>

          <dd> As seen in the figure above, repetition time, TR, is the interval
            between successive excitation pulses. It is the time between the
            start of longitudinal relaxation (regrowth) following saturation,
            and the time at which the longitudinal magnetization is converted to
            transverse magnetization through excitation. </dd> <br/>

          <dt> Echo Time (TE) </dt>

          <dd> Echo time, TE, is the interval between the beginning of
            transverse relaxation following excitation when the magnetization is
            measured to produce image contrast (echo event). </dd>

        </dl>

        <h3>Contrast Sensitivity</h3>

        <p> The MR imaging process is one of creating contrast among tissues
        based on their magnetic characteristics. The primary characteristics are
        proton density (PD), T1, and T2. MRI is a dynamic process in which the
        magnetization levels of various tissues are undergoing almost constant
        change. During each imaging cycle there are two distinct magnetization
        phases: longitudinal and transverse. Different types of contrast are
        developed in each of these phases depending on tissue characteristics
        and selected parameters. </p>

        <p> Tissues characteristics opt for three different contrasts PD, T1 and
        T2. The imaging process can be adjusted so that it has max or at least
        adequate contrast sensitivity for a specific characteristic. The image
        produced is heavily weighted by a specific characteristic (for which the
        imaging process has been adjusted). There are different factors
        depending on the imaging method that determine the contrast sensitivity
        of the resulting image but TR and TE in general are used to control
        contrast sensitivity. </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>T1 Contrast</dt>

            <dd> After application of a saturation pulse, which reduces the
              longitudinal magnetization to zero, the magnetization begins to
              regrow, a process known as T1 relaxation. The rate of regrowth for
              a specific tissue is determined by that tissue’s T1 value. During
              this regrowth, T1 contrast in the form of different levels of
              magnetization is created among the tissues. </dd> <br>

          <img src="../../images/med-imaging/T1-contrast.png" alt=""
               class="center">
          <figure>
            <figcaption>T1 contrast</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <dd> During T1 relaxation, i.e. during the regrowth of longitudinal
            magnetization, different tissues will have different levels of
            magnetization as growth rates (T1 values) for different tissues will
            be different. The figure above depicts the longitudinal relaxation
            for two different tissues with different T1 values. </dd> <br/>

          <dd> The tissue with shorter T1 value experiences a faster regrowth of
            longitudinal magnetization which means it will produce a more
            intense signal that appears brighter in the image. In principle, at
            the beginning of each imaging cycle all tissues are dark. As tissues
            regain longitudinal magnetization, they are rendered bright. The
            intensity of brightness that appears on the depends on the duration
            of the regrowth process, which in turn is determined by the selected
            TR value. When a short TR is used, the regrowth of the longitudinal
            magnetization is interrupted before it reaches its maximum; this
            reduces signal intensity and tissue brightness but produces
            T1-contrast. The selection of a longer TR produces greater signal
            strength but less T1 contrast. To produce a T1-weighted image, the
            value for TR must be rather short so that the T1 contrast is
            significant between two tissues. Nonetheless, the selection of TR
            must be appropriate for the T1 values of the tissues being imaged.
          </dd>

          <br/>

          <dt>Proton Density Contrast (PD Contrast)</dt>
          <img class="center" src="../../images/med-imaging/PD-contrast.png"
               alt="PD contrast">
          <figure>
            <figcaption>PD contrast</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <dd> The concentration of protons in each tissue determines the
            maximum level of magnetization that can be obtained. Differences in
            the PD among tissues with the same T1 values can be used to produce
            image contrast. as shown in the figure above.  The tissue with the
            lower PD reaches a maximum magnetization level that is lower than
            that of the other tissue. The difference in magnetization levels at
            any point in time is because of the difference in PD and is
            therefore the source of PD contrast. </dd> <br/>

          <dd> The basic difference between T1 contrast and PD contrast is that
            T1 contrast is produced by the rate of growth (relaxation), and PD
            contrast is produced by the maximum level to which the magnetization
            grows. In general, T1 contrast predominates in the early part of the
            relaxation phase, and PD contrast predominates in the later
            portion. T1 contrast gradually gives way to PD contrast as
            magnetization approaches the maximum value. A PD-weighted image is
            produced by selecting a relatively long TR value so that the image
            is created in the later portion of the relaxation phase, where
            tissue magnetizations approach their maximum values. The TR values
            at which this occurs depend on the T1 values of the tissues being
            imaged. TR value that is at least three times the T1 values for the
            tissues being imaged produces almost pure PD contrast. </dd>

          <br/>

          <dt>T2 Contrast</dt>

          <dd> When an RF pulse is applied to longitudinal magnetization, it
            converts (flips) it to transverse magnetization, an unstable excited
            magnetic condition that decays with time. This decay process is
            known as the T2 relaxation. The rate of decay of a specific tissue
            depends on that tissue’s T2 value. </dd> <br>

          <img src="../../images/med-imaging/T2-contrast.png" alt=""
               class="center">
          <figure>
            <figcaption>T2 contrast</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <dd>During the decay of transverse magnetization, different tissues
            will have different levels of magnetization because of different
            decay rates, or T2 values. As depicted in the figure above, tissues
            with larger T2 value will have a relatively higher level of
            magnetization as compared to tissues with smaller T2 values. As
            a result, tissues with larger T2 values produce a more intense
            signal and appear brighter in the image. This difference in T2
            values is translated into T2 contrast.  </dd> <br>

        <dd>The transverse relaxation of the two tissues begins with the levels
          of magnetization determined by the PD. This means the PD contrast at
          the end of the longitudinal phase carries over to the beginning of the
          transverse phase. In effect, the transverse phase begins with PD
          contrast but adds T2 contrast as time elapses. As seen in the figure
          above, there is no T2 contrast at the beginning but it develops and
          increases throughout the T2 relaxation (shrink). At the echo event the
          magnetization levels are converted into RF signals that are displayed
          as pixels. The time interval between the beginning of the transverse
          phase and the echo event is called TE. Maximum T2 contrast is obtained
          by using a long TE, however, when a very long TE value is used, the
          level of magnetization thence the strength of the RF signals might be
          too low to form a useful image. Therefore, in selecting TE values,
          a compromise must be made between T2 contrast and good signal
          intensity. </dd>
        </dl>

        <p> Altogether, the transverse magnetization of tissue (T2 values) are
        added to the longitudinal characteristics carried over from the
        longitudinal phase (T1 and PD) to form the MR image. In normal use
        cases, T2 contrast is not added to T1 contrast because these two types
        of contrast oppose each other. When producing a T2-weighted image, it is
        necessary to use a long TR so that minimum T1 contrast over to the
        transverse phase. </p>

        <h3>Signal Acquisition</h3>

        <p> During the relaxation processes, the spins give up their excess
        energy in the form of rf waves and to produce an image we need to pick
        up these waves before they disappear into space. </p>

        <img class="center"
             src="../../images/med-imaging/Signal-Acquistion-MRI.png"
           alt="Receiver Coil Placement">
        <figure>
          <figcaption>Receiver coil placement</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> In order to pick up these rf waves, receiver coils are used. The MR
        signals emitted by the tissues are received by the RF coils (gradient
        coils) placed perpendicular to the external magnetic field. MR signals
        are always detected in presence of a gradient known as the readout
        gradient \(G_{RO}\). Following excitation, the net magnetization within
        the slice is oriented transverse to \(B_o\) and will precess with
        frequency \(\omega_o\). The T2\(^*\) processes induces dephasing of the
        transverse magnetization which can be partially reversed to form an
        echo. As the echo is forming, the readout gradient is applied
        perpendicular to the slice direction. Under the influence of this new
        gradient field, the protons begin to precess at different frequencies
        depending on their position within it. Thereby the echo signals measured
        by the receiver coil has distinctive frequency and phase characteristic
        so that they can be separated from other signals during image
        reconstruction. The magnitude of \(G_{RO}\) and the frequency that is
        detected enable the corresponding position of proton to be
        determined. </p>

        <p> Following excitation, each proton within the excited volume (slice)
        precesses at the same frequency. During detection of the echo, the
        \(G_{RO}\) is applied, causing a variation in the frequencies for the
        protons generating the echo signal. The frequency of precession
        \(\omega_i\) for each proton depends upon its position
        \(x_i\). frequencies measured form the echo are mapped to the
        corresponding position. </p>

        <p> One thing to note is that, these MR signals are only received during
        the \(T2\) relaxation. Now since, \(T2\) is a decaying process, the
        strength of the signal received is strong in the beginning and gradually
        becomes weaker. </p>

        <h3>Slice Selection</h3>

        <p> The initial step after the echo event is the localization of the rf
        excitation to a region of space. Meaning, the MR signal received as
        a result of echo event needs to be traced to a point from which it is
        being broadcast. There are two distinct methods used to create the
        individual slices. </p>

        <ol>

          <li>The method of <em>frequency selective excitation</em>, which
            creates a slice during the acquisition phase. </li>

          <li>Alternative to frequency selective excitation is to acquire
            signals from a large volume of tissues like an organ and then create
            slices during reconstruction process.</li>

        </ol>

        <p> These are referred to as 2D volume and 3D volume acquisition.  Slice
        selection, in either case, is done by applying a gradient, known as the
        slice selection gradient, \(G_{ss}\). The gradient direction determines
        the slice orientation, whereas the steepness of the slope of the
        gradient together with the bandwidth of frequencies incorporated into
        the \(90^o\) rf pulse determines the slice thickness and slice
        position. Thinner slices require larger \(G_{ss}\) steep. </p>

        <img class="center" src="../../images/med-imaging/Slice-thickness.png"
           alt="Slice Thickness">
        <figure>
          <figcaption>Slice Thickness</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> The figure above depicts that for a given bandwidth of frequencies
        incorporated into the rf pulse, the desired slice thickness is
        determined by the amplitude of the slice selection gradient.
        A \(G_{ss}\) of \(4.8\,mT/m\) produces a slice thickness of 5mm and
        a \(G_{ss}\) of \(2.4\,mT/m\) produces a slice thickness of 10mm for
        frequencies ranging from -512 Hz to +512 Hz. </p>

        <p> Normally, the bandwidth is fixed and the slice thickness is changed
        by modifying the amplitude of \(G_{ss}\) as illustrated in the figure
        down below. </p>

        <img class="center"
             src="../../images/med-imaging/Slice-thickness-mods.png"
           alt="Slice thickness modification">
        <figure>
          <figcaption>Slice Thickness Modification</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> Keeping the bandwidth fixed will allow the RF pulses to excite
        tissues in a specific site. </p>

        Nonetheless, multi-slice imaging uses the
        same \(G_{ss}\) but a unique rf pulse during excitation. Each rf pulse
        has the same bandwidth but a different central frequency, thereby
        exciting a different region of tissue. </p>

        <h3>Signal Encoding</h3>

        The MR image formation process subdivides a section of the patient's
        body into a set of slices and then each slice is cut into rows and
        columns to form a matrix of individual tissue voxels. This is achieved
        by encoding signals during the acquisition phase and then, in effect,
        delivering the signal intensities to the appropriate pixels which have
        addresses within the image during the reconstruction phase. Now, since
        there are two dimension in an image, two different method of encoding
        must be used. The two methods of signal encoding are:

        <ol>
          <li> Frequency Encoding </li>
          <li> Phase Encoding </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Frequency Encoding</h4>

        <p> A fundamental characteristic of an RF signal is its
        frequency. Frequency is the number of cycles per second of an
        oscillating signal. The picture below presents the concept of RF signal
        produced by voxels of tissues:</p>

        <img class="center" src="../../images/med-imaging/Frequency-Concept.png"
           alt="">
        <figure>
          <figcaption>RF signal produces by Tissues</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> Tissues produce MR signals only when transverse magnetization is
        present. The unique characteristic of transverse magnetization that
        produces the signal is a spinning magnetic effect. The transverse
        magnetization spins in and out of phase around the axis of the magnetic
        field. A spinning magnet or magnetization in the vicinity of a coil
        generates electricity in the coil. When imaging protons the strength of
        the magnetic field is the factor used to vary the resonant frequency and
        the corresponding frequency of the RF signals. This is illustrated in
        the figure down below: </p>

        <img class="center"
             src="../../images/med-imaging/Frequency-Encoding-Gradient.png"
           alt="Frequency Encoding Gradient">
        <figure>
          <figcaption>Frequency Encoding Gradient</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> In this example, the magnetic field strength is increased from left
        to right. This means each voxel is located in a different field strength
        and is resonating at a frequency different from all others. The
        frequency-encoding gradient is present at the time of the echo event
        when the signals are actually being produced. This frequency-encoding
        gradient is also know as readout gradient, \(G_{RO}\). </p>

        <h4>Phase Encoding</h4>

        <p> The principle of phase encoding is based on the fact that the proton
        precession is periodic in nature. Prior to the application of the phase
        encoding gradient, \(G_{PE}\), a proton within a slice precesses at the
        base frequency \(\omega_o\). In the presence of \(G_{PE}\), it
        precessional frequency increases or decreases. Once \(G_{PE}\) is turned
        off, the proton precession returns to its original frequency, but is
        either ahead or behind in phase relative to its previous state. The
        picture down below illustrates this: </p>

        <img class="center"
             src="../../images/med-imaging/Concept-of-phase-encoding.png"
           alt="Concept of Phase Encoding">
        <figure>
          <figcaption>Concept of Phase Encoding</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> As seen in the figure above, prior to the application of \(G_{PE}\),
        all protons precess at the same frequency. When \(G_{PE}\) is applied,
        a proton increases or decreases it precessional frequency, depending on
        its position \(y\). A proton located at \(y_i = 0\) experiences no
        effect from \(G_{PE}\). Once \(G_{PE}\) is turned off, the protons
        precess at their original frequency but experience a phase shift as
        indicated by the dashed curve. This sort of phase shift  causes the
        spin-rate of the transverse magnetization of one voxel to differ from
        that of another voxel. </p>

        <img class="center" src="../../images/med-imaging/Phase-encoding.png"
           alt="Phase Encoding">
        <figure>
          <figcaption>Phase Encoding Gradient</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> Here, all voxels have the same amount of transverse magnetization
        that is spinning in-phase at the time prior to the application of
        \(G_{PE}\). When the \(G_{PE}\) is turned on, the strength of the
        magnetic field increases from bottom to top. Therefore, the
        magnetization in each voxel is spinning at a different rate with the
        increasing magnetic field strength from bottom to top. This causes the
        magnetization from voxel to voxel to get out of phase which produces
        a phase shift (or phase difference). The amount of induced phase shift
        depends on the magnitude and duration of \(G_{PE}\) as well as the
        position of the proton. The \(G_{PE}\) remains on only for a short
        period of time and then is quickly turned off. As a result, the signals
        from individual voxels are different in terms of their phase
        relationship; which technically means the signals are phase encoded. All
        of the signals are emitted at the same time and mixed together as
        composite echo signal. Later, the reconstruction process will sort the
        individual signal components. Phase encoding is done before frequency
        encoding. </p>

        <p> For each imaging cycle, the phase-encoding gradient is stepped to
          a slightly different value. The signals acquired with a different
          phase-encoding strength fills one row of k space. This is a very
          important point that should be emphasized: <em>Each row of k space is
          reserved for signals with a specific degree of phase encoding
          gradient.</em> The degree of phase-encoding gradient is determined
          by the strength and duration of the gradient during each cycle. The
          phase encoding process is repeated depending on the size of k space
          and that is determined by the image matrix size. </p>


        <h3> Gradients in MRI</h3>

        <p>Various gradients are turned on and off at specific times in each
        imaging cycle. The three gradient activities are:</p>

        <ol>

          <li> <p>The slice selection gradient is on when rf pulses are applied
            to the tissue. The \(G_{ss}\) limits magnetic excitation, inversion
            and echo formation to the tissue located within a specific
            slice. </p> </li>

          <li> <p>The phase-encoding gradient is turned on for a short period in
            each cycle to produce a phase difference in one dimension of the
            image.</p> </li>

          <li> <p>The frequency-encoding gradient is turned on during the echo
            event when the signals are actually emitted by the tissue. This
            causes different voxels to emit signals with different
            frequencies.</p> </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Raw Data and k-Space</h3>

        <p> Raw data is stored and manipulated as a grid or matrix of
        points. The grid contains data measured for a given echo, from a given
        slice or volume of tissue i.e. the matrix represents a slice. Each
        amplitude of each echo signal is measured by the receiver coil and is
        first digitized as a function of time and then converted into a complex
        format. This digital form of the signal is stored as complex data with
        each signal point represented by real and imaginary values. The detected
        signal amplitude for a given echo, corresponds to a row and each row
        differs by the value of \(G_{PE}\) applied prior to detection. This raw
        data matrix is referred to as the \(k\)-space. The \(k\)-space is a grid
        of points with frequency-encoding direction displayed horizontally and
        the phase-encoding direction displayed vertically. Its dimension depends
        on the number of readout data points and the number of phase encoding
        steps. All the information necessary to construct the image is contained
        within the \(k\)-space, given that all the rows of k space must be
        filled with data before the image construction can be performed. The
        image is obtained via 2D Fourier transformation of the \(k\)-space. </p>

        <img class="center" src="../../images/med-imaging/Image-Construction.png"
           alt="Image Construction">
        <figure>
          <figcaption>k-space Mapping</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> The complex array of raw data points in the k-space are treated as
        a two dimensional grid of points \((k_x,k_y)\) where \(k_x\) corresponds
        to a different time point in the readout (frequency encoding) direction
        and each \(k_y\) value corresponds to a different phase-encoding
        gradient amplitude. Each \((k_x,k_y)\) data point corresponds to the
        echo signal amplitude influenced by the combination of
        frequency-encoding and phase-encoding gradients. The total gradient
        influence at each \((k_x,k_y)\) point in the matrix is different and
        unique. The point \((0,0)\) is the origin of the <em>k</em>-space, and
        has the maximum amplitude in the raw data matrix. The contrast of the
        image is primarily determined by data at the center, where as edge
        definition is primarily determined by data at the edges of
        <em>k</em>-space. </p>

        <figure>
          <figcaption>k-space</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> The following illustration makes this concept a bit more clear:</p>

          <figcaption>Contrast and Edge Definitions</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> As seen in each of the pictures above, the <em>k</em>-space is
        divided into four equal quarters by the \(x\) and the \(y\) axis.</p>

        <h3>Image Construction</h3>

        <p>Some folks call this image reconstruction, but the image was never
        constructed so it is not reconstruction rather jut construction.</p>

        <p> The next step in the creation of an MR image is the reconstruction
        process. reconstruction is the mathematical process performed by the
        computer that converts the collected signals in k space into an actual
        image. There are several reconstruction methods, but the one used for
        most clinical applications is the 2D Fourier transformation. The Fourier
        transformation sorts a composite signal into individual frequency
        and phase components. Since each voxel in a row emits a different signal
        frequency and each voxel in a column a different phase, the Fourier
        transformation can determine the location of each signal component and
        direct it to the corresponding pixel. </p>

        <img class="center" src="../../images/med-imaging/Image-Reconstruction-Concept.png"

        <figure>
          <figcaption>Image Reconstruction Concept</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> In the above picture, we can see that (bottom right), each column of
        pixels has a phase address and each row of pixel has a frequency
        address. Therefore each individual pixel has a unique address that
        consists of a combination of frequency and phase values. The frequency
        and phase encoding process during  </p>

        <h3>Image Acquisition Summary</h3>

        <p> This whole image acquisition process in analogous to mail delivery;
        where a mail needs to be posted, collected and then delivered to
        a specific house in a specific street. The echo event is analogous to
        someone posting a mail in a post box. The \(G_{SS}\) is similar to the
        P.O. box number. In the image, each column of pixels has a phase address
        corresponding to a street name and each row of pixels has a frequency
        address corresponding to a house number in that street. Therefore, each
        individual pixel has a unique address consisting of a combination of
        frequency and phase values analogous to a street name and a house
        number. The frequency-encoding and the phase-encoding process during
        acquisition "writes" an address on the signal from each voxel. These
        signals are mixed together and collected in a post-office called
        k space. The signals (mails) are then sorted by the Fourier transform
        process and hopefully delivered to the correct pixel address in the
        image. </p>

        <h3>Pulse Sequence</h3>

        <p>A pulse sequence is the measurement technique by which an MR image
        is obtained.</p> 

        <h4>Spin Echo Pulse Sequence</h4>
        <p>Spin echo pulse sequence is commonly used in MR imaging. It has at
        least two rf pulses, an excitation pulse and one or more 180\(^o\)
        pulses that generate the spin echoes. Spin echo pulse sequence also
        utilizes gradient pulses in the readout and slice selection directions.
        In a spin echo sequence, the repetition time \( TR\) is the time
        between successive excitation pulses for a given slice and the echo
        time \( TE\) is the time from the excitation pulse to the echo event.
        </p> 

        <h3>MRI Artifacts</h3>

        MRI is extremely sensitive to temporal and spatial differences in the sample
        induced magnetic field, which gives rise to a variety of artifacts.

        <ul>
          <li><p>Motion related artifacts: Ghosting and Smearing. When motion
            is periodic the result is complete or incomplete replication of the
            moving tissue which is referred to as ghosting, and is observed
            along the phase encoding direction of the image.  The causes of
            motion artifacts are as follows: </p> 
            <ul>
              <li> Esophageal contraction </li>
              <li> Respiration </li>
              <li> Cardiac activity </li>
              <li> Bowel peristalsis </li>
              <li> Other voluntary motions </li>
            </ul>

            <p>A wide variety of techniques can be employed to minimize motion
            artifacts. Swapping the phase and the frequency encoding direction
            is a common measure. Some other remedies are ECG gating, pre
            saturation, gradient moment nulling, fat suppression, and multiple
            signal averaging. </p> 
          </li>

          <li><p>Susceptibility artifacts: These arise due to the differences
            in magnetic susceptibility of tissues and are usually seen around
            metal implants, and at air-tissue and air-bone interfaces.
            Susceptibility artifacts get worse with long TE and gradient echo
            pulse sequences.</p> 

            <p>Susceptibility artifacts can be reduced by performing the
            imaging at low magnetic field strengths, using smaller voxels,
          decreasing the TE time period and increasing the receiver bandwidth.
            </p> </li>

            <li>
              <p>Wrap around artifact is another type of artifact seen in MRI
              imaging. It occurs when the dimensions of a part of the imaged
              anatomy in phase encoding direction  (vertical axis) exceeds the
              FOV.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Truncation or Gibbs artifact are bright or dark lines seen
              parallel and adjacent to borders of abrupt intensity change. It
              is caused by incomplete digitization of the echo or insufficient
              samples of data.</p>
            </li>

            <li><p>Zipper artifact resulting from the contamination of the MR
              scanner environment by spurious RF signal.</p></li>

            <li><p>Cross talk or Cross contamination artifact caused due to the
              interference between slices due to imperfect slice profiles.</p></li>

            <li><p>Clipping artifact</p></li>
            <li><p>Chemical shift artifact</p></li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Some definitions to remember</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Flip angle:</p>

            <p>FA is the degree of rotation of the net magnetization towards the
            transverse plane. In gradient-echo pulse sequences, the FA ranges from
            1 to 90\(^o\) and in  spin echo pulse sequences, the FA is greater than
            90\(^o\) </p> 
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Inversion Time</p>

            <p>It is the duration of time between the inversion pulse and the
            excitation pulse. The inversion time is responsible for selective
            suppression of signals.</p> 
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Number of Acquisition (NA)</p>

            <p>NA is also know as the number of excitation or number of signal
            averaging. It determines how many times a scan is repeated. Higher NAs
            has less noise and therefore high SNR, fewer artifacts but the scan
            time increases as NAs is increased.</p> 
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Matrix Size</p>

            <p>Matrix size determines the spatial resolution of the image. It has
            two side MX\(_{PE}\) and MX\(_{RO}\). The matrix size can be increased
            or decreased in steps of 32.</p> 
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Field of View (FOV)</p>

            <p>FOV determines how much of the anatomical region will be imaged.
            Increasing the FOV will result in lower spatial resolution.</p> 
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Slice Gap</p>

            <p>Slice gap is the amount of space between slices and is expressed
            in percentage of the slice thickness. In contiguous slices, there is
            overlapping of signals which is referred to as crosstalk. Slice gap of
            10-20% is usually used to reduce crosstalk. </p> 
          </li>

          <li><p>Resolution, Spatial Resolution and Temporal Resolution</p>

            <p> Resolution is the PPI in an image</p> 

            <p> and spatial resolution is the ability of an imaging modality to
            differentiate two adjacent structures as being distinct from one
            another. </p>

            <p>Temporal resolution refers to the duration of time for
            acquisition of a single frame of image.</p>
