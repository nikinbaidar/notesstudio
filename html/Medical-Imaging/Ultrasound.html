        <h3>Properties of US Beam</h3>

        <ul>

          <li><p> The area through which the sound energy is emitted from the
            US transducer travels is the US beam. US are sound waves whose
            frequency is \(> 2000 Hz\), sound waves of ranger 1 to 30 MHz are
            used in medical applications.. </p>
          </li>

        <li><p>Beam Shape</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The beam is three dimensional and is symmetrical around its
              central axis.</li>
            <li>It can be divided into two regions: a near field (or Fresnel,
              pronounced fre-nel) zone) which is cylindrical in shape and a far
              field (or Fraunhofer zone) where it diverges and becomes
              cone-shaped.</li>
            <li>The actual shape of the beam depends on the diameter of the
              crystal, the frequency and wavelength and the design of the
              transducer. Higher frequency waves correspond to longer Fresnel
              zone.</li>
          </ul> </li>

          <li><p>Beam Intensity: The intensity of the beam is the power flowing
          through a unit area. The intensity throughout the beam's length or
          width is not uniform.</p> </li>

        <li><p>US beams are non-ionizing and longitudinal.</p></li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Characteristics of Piezoelectric Crystal</h3>

        <p> The commonly used piezoelectric crystal in US transducers is PZT
        (Lead Zirconate Titanate), as these have strong response in
        transmission and reception. They can be formed in different shapes and
        sizes depending upon their applications. The transducer Q factor
        describes the shape of the frequency response curve and is defined as
        \[Q = \frac{f_o}{f_2 - f_1} \]

          Clearly, the transducer Q factor is determined by two characteristics
          of the piezoelectric crystal, frequency and bandwidth.</p>

        <p>Curie temperature is the temperature beyond which a crystal loses
        its piezoelectricity. </p>

        <p>Resonant frequency of the piezoelectric crystal is determined by the
        thickness of the crystal. Resonance becomes maximum when the frequency
        of the crystal matches its natural/resonant frequency.</p>

        <h3>Ultrasound Transducer</h3>

        <p> An ultrasound transducer is a device that converts electrical
        energy into mechanical energy (acoustic energy) and vice versa.  So ,
        the ultrasound transducers serve two functions in ultrasonography: </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>It converts the electrical energy provided by a transmitter into
            acoustic pulses. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The transducer also serves as the receiver of reflected echoes,
            converting weak pressure changes into electric signals. </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p> Transducer components </p> 

        <ol>
          <li>Piezoelectric crystal (PZT)</li>
          <li>Matching layer</li>
          <li>Damping layer</li>
          <li>acoustic insulator</li>
          <li>Metal shield</li>
          <li>Plastic housing</li>
          <li>Transducer leads (to transmitter)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Pulse Echo Principle</h3>

        <p> In most clinical applications, a pulsed ultrasound is used, in
        which brief bursts of acoustic energy are transmitted into the body.
        The ultrasound transducer is energized by application of a precisely
        timed, high-amplitude voltage. The time interval between the ultrasound
        pulses is controlled by the transducer. </p> 

        <p>In pulse echo method, a short ultrasound pulse is emitted from the
        transducer. This pulse travels along a beam pointing in a given
        direction. The ultrasound beams are parallel at the surface of the
        transducer and start livering at a distance from the transducer
        (Fresnel and Fraunhofer zones). The us beam penetrates through the
        superficial and get reflected back after striking a structure. This
        reflected signal is is referred to as the echo signal or the  received
        signal. The echoes generated by the pulse are recorded by the
        transducer. The later an echo is received, the deeper is the location of
        the structure giving rise to the echo. Depth resolution is superior with
        us beam that have a longer Fresnel zone. </p>

        <p> In addition to that, the amplitude of the echo signal is
        proportional to the average specific acoustic impedance difference
        between the structure and the tissue just above. An image is then
        created by repeating this process with the beam scanning the
        tissue. </p>

        <h3>Ultrasound Modes</h3>

        <h4>Amplitude Mode (A mode)</h4>

        <p> The A mode is only used in ophthalmology to view the optic never.
        In this mode, the echoes are displayed as spikes projecting from a base
        line. </p> 

        <h4>Brightness Modulation (B Mode))</h4>

        <p> The B mode is the most common mode used in ultrasonography. Unlike
        A mode, B mode does not have vertical spikes. The image brightness
        depends on the amplitude or intensity of the echo. B mode displayers
        images as large and small dots, which represents citron and weak echoes
        respectively. </p> 

        <h4>Motion Mode (M Mode)</h4>

        <p> This mode is also referred as the time-motion (or TM) mode. It is
        used to image one dimensional structures, that is uid for analyzing
        movement of body parts. For example, for imaging blood flow in blood
        vessel (one-dimensional). This is mostly common in cardiac and foetal
        cardiac imaging. </p> 

        <p> This is accomplished by recording the amplitude and the rate of
        motion in real time by repeatedly measuring the distance of the object
        form the sidle transducer at a given moment. </p> 

        <h3>Real Time Imaging</h3>

        <p> Real time imaging systems are those that have frame rates fast
        enough to allow movement to be followed. A real time ultrasound
        transducer can produce multiple frames in a very short time typically
        at least 10 frames per second. </p> 

        <h3>Image Quality in Ultrasound</h3>

        <p> The key factors that determine the image quality of an ultrasound
        image includes spatial, contrast and temporal resolution. </p> 

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Spatial Resolution must be considered in 3 planes and there are
            different determinants of resolution in each of these.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Axial or depth resolution: this is the ability of US beam to
                separate two objects lying in tandem along the axis of the beam
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Lateral or horizontal resolution is the ability of the US
                beam to separate two adjacent tissues (or objects). It refers
                to resolution in the plane perpendicular to the beam and
                parallel to the transducer. The lateral resolution is
                determined by the width of the beam. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Azimuth or Elevation resolution is the slice thickness in
                the plane perpendicular to the beam and to the transducer. It
                is determined by the construction of the transducer and
                generally, it cannot be controlled. </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Artifacts in Ultrasound</h3>

        <p>Different type of artifacts in ultrasound are as follows: </p> 
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Reverberation Artifact: This arises when the ultrasound signal
            reflects repeatedly between highly reflective interfaces that are
            usually near the transducer. It may also give a false impression of
            solid structures in areas where only fluid is present. To minimize
            reverberation artefact, the transducer placement i.e. the scanning
            angle must be changed. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Side lobe artifact: Although most of the energy transmitted by
            the transducer is confined at (emitted along) the center of the US
            beam, some energy is also emitted at the periphery of the primary
            beam. These energy (at the periphery) are called side lobes and
            have a lower intensity than the primary beam. However, these side
            lobes may interact with strong reflectors that lie outside the scan
            plane and produce artifacts.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Shadowing: Shadows may result when an object attenuates sound
            more rapidly than surrounding tissues. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Vanishing twin artifact: The refraction of ultrasound from
            supra-pubic regions may produce double outline of pelvic structures
            or may even produce double structures themselves, which hides one
            of the embryo in early pregnancy. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Comet tail artifact is produced due to large number of bubbles
            present in the bowel gas.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Mirror image artifact is normally seen at the air-pleura
            interface above the diaphragm. It occurs when the reflector lies at
            some angle to the US beam. US is strikes the tissue at an angle and
            is reflected back to the transducer (after multiple reflections)
            which gives an impression as being seen from a mirror. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> Increase through transmission: This artifact is associated with
            attenuation errors. When the US beam encounters weakly attenuating
            structure, the amplitude of the beam beyond this structure is
            greater than the beam amplitude at the same depth in the rest of
            the field. The echoes returning from structures deep to the weak
            attenuator will be of higher amplitude and will be falsely
            displayed as a bright band extending from an object. </p>
          </li>
        </ul> 

        <h3>Interaction of US with matter</h3>

        <p> A beam of ultrasound may interact with matter in 5 possible ways -
        reflection, scattering, refraction, absorption and attenuation. Here's
        a diagrammatic representation of how these look: </p> 


        <p> The US image is produced by the reflected portion of the originally
        transmitted beam. There are two factors the influence reflection:
        <ul>
          <li>The acoustic impedance between tissues  </li>
          <li>The beam angle i.e. the placement of ultrasound transducer</li>
        </ul>

        In ultrasound, there can be two types of reflections \(-\) Specular and
        diffuse reflections. If the reflecting interface is large and smooth, it
        reflects sound as much as a mirror reflects light. Such interfaces are
        called specular interfaces and such reflections are referred to as
        specular reflections. On the other hand, if the reflecting interface
        is rough and has smaller structures with individual dimensions smaller
        than the wavelength of incident sound then the echoes from these
        interface undergo scattering in all directions and only some of the
        incident rays are reflected back. These reflectors are called diffuse
        reflectors and the phenomenon is called diffuse reflection.
        </p> 

        <p> Refraction occurs when sound passes through a tissue with one
        acoustic propagation velocity to another tissue with a different
        acoustic propagation velocity. Knowing the refraction index allows
        operators to adjust the beam angle so that it is perpendicular to the
        interface, which inturn minimizes the artifacts seen on the image. </p> 

        <p> Another way that an US beam interacts with matter is absorption.
        The intensity of the ultrasound beam falls off rapidly as it propagates
        through soft tissues. This is the most dominant cause of energy loss,
        especially in soft tissues. The frequency of sound and the viscosity of
        the medium determine the amount of absorption. </p> 

        <p> Scattering occurs, as suggested above, when the sound strikes a
        rough surface. The amount of scatter depends on the dimensions of the
        individual structures present on the surface. The US beam does not
        loose any energy when it is scattered, it just changes the direction of
        propagation. Generally, the energy which does not interact with the
        target is redirected in almost all directions. For instance, US beams
        encountering blood are scattered in all directions. </p> 

        <p> Attenuation isn't exactly interaction of sound with matter, rather
        it is the result of other interactions. A sound passes through the
        tissues, it loses energy through transfer of energy to tissue by
        absorption, scattering, and refraction. The energy is lost in the form
        of heat and this loss of energy is termed as "attenuation". Attenuation
        is determined by 

        <ul>
          <li>The resonating frequency: attenuation increases in proportion to
            resonating frequency, resulting in less penetration at higher
            frequencies. (Isn't this in contrast with the Fresnel zone logic??)
          </li>
          <li>The nature of the attenuation medium: Attentuation values for
            normal tissues have considerable deviations. For example,
            attenutation value for water 0.00 and for air, it is 10. </li>
        </ul>
        </p> 

      <h3>Doppler Ultrasound</h3>

      <h4>Principle</h4>

      <p> The doppler ultrasound depends on the principle of Doppler effect.
      The doppler effect is the change in perceived frequency of sound emitted
      by a moving source. </p> 

      <h3>Reasons why Ultrasonography is popular in Medical Applications</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>No ionizing radiation</li>
        <li>Opts for real time imaging using doppler ultrasound</li>
        <li>Can be done in almost all type of patients</li>
        <li>Lower cost</li>
        <li>Lower time</li>
        <li>Portable and easily accessible</li>
      </ul>
