Spatial resolution refers to the ability to distinguish between small structures in an image, such as tiny features or details. Contrast, on the other hand, refers to the difference in brightness or density between different areas of an image. Spatial frequency is a measure of the number of cycles of a repeating pattern that are present in a given unit of space."
