            <h2>Importance of Medical Industries in Nepal</h2>

            <p> Establishment of medical industry in local society can be
            beneficial in a number of different aspects. The role of medical
            industry in Nepalese society are as follows: </p>


            <ol>
            <li>Creation of employment opportunities</li>
            <p>
            With the establishment of medical industries,
            employment opportunities can also be created for different people
            from different sectors. For example, if an industry that
            manufactures x-ray machines is established, then employment of
            biomedical engineers, electronic engineers, fniance officers and
            many other human resources will get employment. 
            </p>


            <li>Reduced costs of medical devices</li> 

            <p>
            When devices are manufactured locally, the costs of
            the device decreases significantly as the import tariffs and
            transportation costs are cut-off. For example, if x-ray machines
            are produced in Nepal, the cost of the machine will be reduced in
            great proportions. That means the costs for x-ray scans will also
            be reduced. 
            </p>


            <li>Utilization of local resources</li> 

            <p>
            The establishment of medical industries, specially pharmaceuticals
            in Nepal would mean the natural resources found in our county would
            be utilized in proper ways. There’s a plethora of medicinal herbs
            available in Nepal, those herbs can be utilized to their best if
            pharmaceutical industries are established in Nepal. Example— herbs
            such as Yarshagumba (Cordyceps Sinesis), Ashwagandha and many more
            can found in nepal can be properly processed and used in medical
            applications. 
            </p>


            <li>Earlier access to newer technologies</li> 

            <p>
            Technological developments that occur in the medical industries are
            not easily available in Nepal. Medical procedures that use advanced
            technologies are not available in Nepal, even if they are available
            after several years of the initial development, they are extremely
            expensive. Due to this most patients in need of such technology
            must travel abroad to get access to such treatments or procedures.
            If medical industries for those technological advancements are
            established in Nepal itself (i) Nepali people can get their hands
            on such new technology at a much earlier time, (ii) the quality of
            clinical services will be improved and (iii) in agreement with the
            previous point, the cost, including travel expenses to get access
            to such technology is greatly reduced. An example of such would be
            MRI technology; MRI was introduced around 1977 but in Nepal, the
            MRI procedure was introduced only after the year 2000. 
            </p>


            <li>Stops skilled manpowers from leaving the country</li> 

            <p>
            Many educated personnels are leaving the country seeking better
            career opportunities and income in foreign countries. If medical
            industries are established in the county itself, skilled man power
            can get motivated to stay in Nepal and work here instead of flying
            abroad, provided the said industry can provide the career and
            income those personnels aspire to have. A pretty good example of
            such is, a biomedical engineer which is a highly educated and
            skilled position in our country are compelled to work in suppliers
            or hospitals with very low income where as in abroad they can work
            in industries in a better position with promising income.
