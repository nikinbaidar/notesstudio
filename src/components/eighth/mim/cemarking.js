            <li>
            Choose a conformity assessment route (More on this below).
            </li>

            <li>
            Compile the technical documentation for declaration of conformity and, where necessary, obtain certification from a Notified Body.
            </li>

            <li>
            Appoint an authorized representative, either a freelancer or a consultant in order to register with a Competent Authority (CA). Hold the technical files for inspection by the CA. Once the manufacturer is satisfied that their products meet all the relevant essential requirements, the manufacturer or their authorized representative must register with the CA.
            </li>

            <li>
            Following that, the manufacturer may affix the CE marking on their products and place them on the market.

            <h2>Class I<sub>m</sub> and I<sub>s</sub> Medical Devices</h2>

            <p>
            As for class I<sub>a</sub> and I<sub>b</sub> medical devices, the manufacturer declares
            conformity with the provisions of the directive and regulations and ensures
            that his products comply with relevant essential requirements. The manufacturer
            is responsible for ensuring that his product complies with all the relevant
            essential requirements of the directive. A manufacturer must draw up a written
            statement to this effect (self-declaration).
            </p>

            <p>
            Class I medical device <i>without a measuring function</i> and supplied in
            <i>non-sterile</i> conditions does not require the involvement of a notified
            body. Conformity to the International and European Standard EN ISO:13485 is
            voluntary. On the other hand, manufacturers of I<sub>s</sub> and I<sub>m</sub> medical devices
            must apply to a notified body for certification of the aspects of manufacture
            relating to sterility or metrology. For both I<sub>s</sub> and I<sub>m</sub> medical devices, follow
            Annex 4, 5 and 6.

            devices:

            <h2>Class II<sub>a</sub> Medical Devices</h2>

            <p>
            In the case of devices falling within class II<sub>a</sub>, other than devices which
            are custom made or intended for clinical investigations, the manufacturer
            shall, in order to affix the CE marking, follow the procedures relating to the
            EC declaration of conformity set out in various Annexes. Unlike for class I,
            where the manufacturer themselves declare conformity, declaration for class
            II<sub>a</sub> products must be backed up in all cases with conformity assessment by a
            Notified Body.
            </p>

            <p>
            For Class II<sub>a</sub>, there are also two routes. Annex 2 or Annex 7 and Annex 4, 5, or 6.
            Annex 2 costs more so usually the route with Annex 7 and then Annex 4, 5, or 6
            is chosen.
            </p>

            devices:

            choice, be (i) examination and testing each product or
            homogeneous batch of products (Annex 4), or (ii) audit of the
            production quality assurance system excluding design (Annex 5),
            or (iii) audit of final inspection and testing excluding design
            & manufacture, or (iv) an audit of full quality assurance system
            (Annex $2$). Involvement of a notified body is mandatory in all
            cases.</figcaption>

            <h2>Class II<sub>b</sub> Medical Devices</h2>

            <p>
            In case of devices falling within class II<sub>b</sub>, other than devices which are
            custom-made or intended for clinical investigations, the manufacturer shall, in
            order to affix the CE marking either follow the procedure relating to the EC
            declaration of conformity set out in various annexes. Like Class II<sub>a</sub>, for
            Class II<sub>b</sub>, there are two routes. Annex 2 or Annex 3 and then Annex 4, 5
            or 6.

            type-examination (Annex 3), followed by either (i) examination
            and testing each product or homogeneous batch of products , or

            <h2>Class III Medical Devices</h2>


            <p>Conformity routes for class III medical devices is very analogous to that for
            class II<sub>b</sub> except that if the manufacturer chooses to audit the full quality
            assurance, they must also perform a design dossier examination, and if the
            manufacturer chooses to perform a type examination, it must be followed by
            either (i) examination and testing of each product or homogeneous batch of
            products (Annex 4) or (ii) a production quality assurance excluding the
            design (Annex 5) (but not Annex 6).</p>
