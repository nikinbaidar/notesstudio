            <h1>Reclassification</h1>

            <h2>Reclassification of IUCDs</h2>

            <p>An IUCD (Intra-uterine Contraceptive Device) is a small T-shaped device, which is placed inside the uterus to prevent pregnancy. These devices were previously classified based on:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Intended use - As a birth control measure.</li>
            <li>Duration of continuous use - Long term</li>
            <li>Invasiveness - Invasive with respect to a body orifice (through vagina)</li>
            <li>Type - Implantable</li>
            <li>Placement - Uterus</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Rule 5 of Annex IX: All devices (invasive) with respect to body orifice, other than surgically invasive devices, and which are not intended to be connected to an active medical device are:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>in class I if they are intended for transient use</li>
            <li>class IIa, if they are intended to be used for a short term, except if they are to be used in the oral cavity as far as the pharynx, in the ear canal up to the ear drum or in the nasal cavity, in which case they are in class I.</li>
            <li>are in class IIb if they are intended for long term, except if they are to be used in the oral cavity as far as the pharynx, in the ear canal up to the ear drum or in the nasal cavity in which case they are in class IIa.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>So IUCDs were initially put in class IIb. However, as the risks associated with the IUCDs started to become known with time, the devices were re-classified to class III as per Rule 14 of the Annex IX: All devices used for contraception or the prevention of the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases are in class IIb, unless they are implantable or long-term invasive devices, in which case they are in class III.</p>

            <p>The major reasons for these re-classification are:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Infection. IUCDs posed risk of worsening an already existing infection in the womb.</li>
            <li>Expulsion. The IUCDs may fall out of its place without the person noticing.</li>
            <li>Lost threads. When the IUCD is inserted, the threads dangle out of the cervix. These threads will often come to lie against the cervix, in the cervical mucus and often get ripped off.</li>
            <li>Damage to the wombs. The fitting of an IUCD can, albeit rarely, can make a small hole in the womb. This is called perforation. It protrudes through the uterus walls and may escape through the pelvis.</li>
            <li>To ensure, these devices undergo design dossier examination so that a device with a rather faulty design does not get placed into the market.</li>
            <li>In addition to these, some IUCDs have hormone coating which produces a biological effect.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Reclassification of IOLs</h2>

            <p>IOLs (Intra Occular Lens) is a lens implanted in the eyes as part of the treatment of cataract, or myopia (shortsightedness). The IOLs are implanted to replace the eye's natural lens after being removed during cataract surgery and are also often used after vision correction surgery. The IOL consists of a small plastic lens with plastic struts called haptics to hold the lens in place in the capsular bag inside the eye. IOLs were previously classified as class IIb medical devices based on:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Intended use - Either to correct myopia or restore other vision defects</li>
            <li>Duration of continuous use - Long term</li>
            <li>Invasiveness - Surgically invasive</li>
            <li>Type - Implantable</li>
            <li>Placement - Eyes</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Rule 8 per Annex IX states that, long-term surgically invasive devices or implantable devices are in class IIb unless they are to be used in the teeth, come in direct contact with the heart and the central circulatory system, or get absorbed, bring about any biological changes, or undergo any chemical changes inside the human body.</p>

            <p>Initially due to unknown risks and similar other factors, these devices were placed in the lower class IIb. However, later as risks associated with the device started to become known, the original classification of the device was changed from class IIb to class III through section 513(e) and section 513(f)(3). The major reasons for this reclassification are as follows:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>To ensure an appropriate conformity assessment was taken before market placement.</li>
            <li>Due to the risks associated with it, such as infections, loosening of the IOL, lens rotation, and night-time halos and also due to elevated risks of revision surgery.</li>
            <li>To achieve optimal levels of safety as class III medical devices need to undergo design dossier examination which ensures only the best and safest of the devices reach the market.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Hence, IOLs being an invasive device to be used in a sensitive organ of the body, needed to be properly examined and approved by the notified bodies and regulatory authorities to ensure such devices are of optimal quality and do not pose any risks to the patient.</p>

            <h2>Reclassification of THRs</h2>

            <p>THR (Total Hip Replacement) is a prosthetic component used to replace the degenerated or broken hip joints. THR is a complex joint with multiple components, composed mainly of metals. The THR consists of acetabular components, femoral head, and the femoral stem. These components are attached to the natural bone using bone cement or press fit techniques.</p>

            <p>Originally, THRs were classified into class IIb medical devices based on:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Intended purpose - To replace the hip joint</li>
            <li>Duration of continuous use - Long term</li>
            <li>Invasiveness - Surgically invasive</li>
            <li>Type - Implantable</li>
            <li>Placement - Lower body / Hip</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Rule 8 of Annex IX- All long-term surgically invasive medical devices are in class IIb unless they are:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>to be placed in the teeth, in which case they are in class IIa</li>
            <li>come in direct contact with the heart, or the central circulatory system, in which case they are in class III</li>
            <li>have some biological effect or to be wholly or mainly absorbed inside the body, in which case they are in class III.</li>
            <li>undergo some chemical changes inside the body, except the devices that are placed in the teeth, or the devices that are used to administer medicine in which case they are in class III.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>So, THRs were placed in class IIb as per rule 8, but with the increasing use of THRs, more risks associated with them started to become known. THRs are reclassified from IIb to III due to the following reasons:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>To ensure an appropriate conformity assessment route was taken before placing THR implants into the market</li>
            <li>To eliminate design related problems, as class III medical devices undergo design dossier examination.</li>
            <li>To achieve optimum levels of safety for the patient.</li>
            <li>Due to the increased risks of revision surgery.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Since THR is a complex load-bearing and sophisticated implant, each device needed to be checked by the notified body before market placement. The reclassification ensured that THR implants will be properly examined before being approved by the notified body.</p>
