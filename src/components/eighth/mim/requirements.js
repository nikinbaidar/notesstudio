            <h1>Essential Principles &amp; Safety of Medical Device</h1>

            <h2>Harmonization Of Safety And Performance Criteria</h2>

            <p>Great need to harmonize essential safety and performance criteria for a medical device that allows the manufacturer to demonstrate that their product is suitable for its intended purpose. This goal was achieved through the publication of guidance on the subject entitled <em>Essential Principles of Safety and Performance of Medical Devices</em> in 2005. It applied to the majority of medical devices and also to in vitro diagnostic devices.</p>

            <h2>Why was it necessary to harmonize safety and performance criteria of medical devices?</h2>
            <p>Harmonization, i.e. consistent identification, selection and application of safety and performance principles to a medical device offers significant benefits to the manufacturer, retailer or supplier, surgeon, patient, and also to regulatory authorities because it allows its manufacturer to design, manufacture and demonstrate that the device is suitable for its intended use. Moreover, eliminating differences between jurisdictions decreases the cost of gaining regulatory compliance, which in turn allows earlier access to new technologies and treatment procedures.</p>

            <h1>Essential Requirements for Medical Devices</h1>

            <h2>General Requirements for Safety and Performance of Particular Medical Devices</h2>

            <h3>General Requirement 1</h3>
            <p>The device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that, when used under conditions and for the purposes intended and where applicable by virtue of the technical knowledge, experience, education or training of intended users, they will not compromise the clinical condition or the safety of patients, or the safety and health of users or where applicable other persons provided that any risks which may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patients and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety.</p>

            <h3>General Requirement 2</h3>
            <p>The solutions adopted by the manufacturer for the design and manufacture of the devices should conform to safety principles, taking account of the generally acknowledged state-of-the-art. When risk reduction is required, the manufacturer should control the risks so that the residual risks associated with each hazard is judged acceptable.</p>
            <p>The manufacturer should apply the following principles in the priority order listed:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Identify known or foreseeable hazards and estimate the associated risks arising from the intended use and foreseeable misuse.</li>
            <li>Eliminate risks as far as reasonably practicable through inherently safe design and manufacture.</li>
            <li>Reduce the remaining risks as far as is reasonably practicable by taking adequate protection measures, including alarms.</li>
            <li>Inform users of any residual risks due to any shortcomings of the protection measures adopted.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>General Requirement 3</h3>
            <p>Devices should achieve the performance intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in such a way that they are suitable for one or more of the functions within the scope of the definition of a medical device applicable in each jurisdiction.</p>

            <h3>General Requirement 4</h3>
            <p>The characteristics and performance of medical devices should not be adversely affected to such a degree that the health or safety of the patient or the user, and where applicable, of other persons are compromised during the lifetime of the device as indicated by the manufacturer when the device is subjected to the stresses which can occur during normal conditions of use and has been properly maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</p>

            <h3>General Requirement 5</h3>
            <p>The devices should be designed, manufactured, and packaged in such a way that their characteristics and performances during their intended use will not be adversely affected during transport and storage, for example, due to changes in temperature and humidity levels or other environmental conditions, taking account of the instructions and information provided by the manufacturer.</p>

            <h3>General Requirement 6</h3>
            <p>The benefits must be determined to outweigh any undesirable side effects for the purposes intended.</p>

            <h3>Requirements regarding design and construction</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Chemical, physical, and biological properties.</li>
            <li>Infection and microbial contamination.</li>
            <li>Construction and environmental properties.</li>
            <li>Precision of devices with a diagnostic or a measuring function.</li>
            <li>Protection against radiation.</li>
            <li>Protection against the risks posed to the patient by devices that are connected to or equipped with an energy source.</li>
            <li>Protection against the risk posed to the patient by devices used for self-testing and self-administration.</li>
            <li>Protection against mechanical and thermal risks.</li>
            <li>Information supplied by the manufacturer | comprises the details on the labels, warnings or safety instructions and instructions for use.
            Each device must be accompanied by the information needed to use it safely and to identify the manufacturer, taking account of the training and knowledge of the potential users. As far as practicable, any warnings and the information required to safely use the device must be included on the device itself and/or packaging of the device. If this is not possible, then the information must be supplied in an instruction manual that must be included in the packaging of each unit. The instructions, where possible, should take the form of symbols or drawings showing how to use the device correctly.
            The labels must bear the following particulars:
            <ul>
            <li>the name of trade name and address of the manufacturer</li>
            <li>Details strictly necessary for the user to uniquely identify the device and contents of the packaging. Bar codes, LOT numbers, product keys (for software), license number, and so on.</li>
            <li>where appropriate, the words: "STERILE", "USE AND THROW", "SINGLE USE ONLY", "CUSTOM MADE DEVICE", and "EXCLUSIVELY FOR CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS", "DO NOT ACCEPT IF SEAL IS BROKEN", "CHOKING HAZARD".</li>
            <li>where appropriate the indication of the manufactured date and the expiry date or the time frame within which the product shall be used such as "Best before 24 months of manufacture date".</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Performance evaluation including, where appropriate, a clinical evaluation.</li>
            </ol>
