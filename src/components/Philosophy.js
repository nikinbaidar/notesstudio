            <p>Our philosophy centers around simplicity, minimalism, and usability. This web app is built using ReactJS. Each component does one thing and, does it well. We strongly believe that this approach should be the prevailing philosophy in the IT industry. Unfortunately, the current software industry seems to lean towards complexity, error-proneness, and sluggishness. Our aim is to challenge this trend through our software projects, demonstrating the opposite.</p>


            <p>Creating software that is simple and elegant proves to be more challenging than allowing ad-hoc or overly ambitious features to clutter the code over time. However, it is a necessary price to pay in order to achieve reliability and maintainability. Additionally, adopting minimalism sets realistic and achievable goals. We are committed to upholding minimalism and clarity in order to drive development towards successful completion.</p>

            <p> Many people are proud if they achieve large amounts of code, becuase they belive the more lines of code they've written, the more progress they have made. The more progress they have made, the more skilled they are. This is simply a delusion.</p>
